# Timeless

A 2D meta-time strategy engine written in C.

## Description:

The engine for making a multiplayer strategy game with an active time travel mechanics like going into the past to change the units you make or give different orders to units or chronoporting your units into the past or future.

The engine works with a map made out of nodes, which act as places where you can build structures and your units fight. The nodes are abstract and don't have any sub-maps on them, so there is no positioning of units involved.


### TODO:
* Make a settings file that people can edit to change stuff like default values that are assigned to maps or unit, structure and node types, etc. (needed for saving maps)
* Get nodes and maps working
* Make a viewable map with nodes working (Maybe also make a map viewer.exe or something
* Get Structures and units working
* Get timewaves, timeline and commands working
* Make the engine easily scriptable to the point that you can make the whole game just using scripts
* Get prototype working
* Find a way to get the game to be moddable in a safe way
