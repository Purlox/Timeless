# Timeless

A 2D meta-time strategy engine written in C.

## Description:

The engine for making a multiplayer strategy game with an active time travel mechanics like going into the past to change the units you make or give different orders to units or chronoporting your units into the past or future.

The engine works with a map made out of nodes, which act as places where you can build structures and your units fight. The nodes are abstract and don't have any sub-maps on them, so there is no positioning of units involved.

The engine will mainly support Windows, but might support Linux and OS X too in the future.
