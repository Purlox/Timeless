# Timeless

A meta-time strategy engine.

## Description:

The engine for making a multiplayer strategy game with an active time travel mechanics like going into the past to change the units you make or give different orders to units or chronoporting your units into the past or future.

The engine works with a map made out of nodes, which act as places where you can build structures and your units fight. The nodes are abstract and don't have any sum-maps on them, so there is no positioning of units involved.

### TODO:
* Get nodes and maps working
* Get Structures and units working
* Get timewaves and timeline working
* Get prototype working
* Make a settings file that people can edit to change stuff like default values that are assigned to maps
