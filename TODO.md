# ToDo list

### Very high priority:

_Reserved for game breaking bugs mainly._


### High priority:

* Finish loading and saving of maps
* Get maps to display well
* Make unit and structure functions necessary for basic functionality
* Get units and structures to display
* Add more unit and structure functions so they can attack each other and other stuff
* Make a timeline with write-able orders on it and the ability to jump to different points in time
* Make timewaves that propagate orders/events (or maybe just write them down into a struct?)

### Medium priority:

* Make a settings file parser that will load stuff like resolution, default values for maps, etc.
* Add ability to see two points in time at once
* Add more races
* Make the engine scriptable (at least so that units, structures, nodes, maps etc. are easy to create, add, change, remove, etc.)

### Low priority:

* Get nice art assets
